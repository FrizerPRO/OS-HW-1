Bill Gates: mixing maths and money to build Microsoft
A. At school Gates excelled in mathematics and the sciences. By the age of 13 he was deeply engrossed in software programming. He began pro- gramming and bug fixing for the Computer Center Corporation, and in 1970 Gates formed a venture with a fellow school student and Microsoft co- founder, Paul Allen, to make traffic counters using the Intel 8008 processor.
B. By the early 1990s, Windows had driven other Dos-based GUIs like Gem and Geos out of the market. It performed a similar feat with the Office productivity suite. Gates fought hard to establish
Microsoft’s dominant position in the software industry. His ability to get Mi- crosoft software pre-installed on most PCs shipped in the world made Microsoft the world’s largest software house and Gates one of the world’s richest men.
С. Since 2000, Gates has given away about £15.5bn to charity. Fictional Gates characters have appeared in cartoons including the Simpsons, South Park and Family Guy.
D. Gates was born in Seattle, Washington in 1955 to a wealthy family: his father was a prominent lawyer and his mother served on the board of direc- tors for First Interstate Bank and The United Way.
E. Gates stood down as chief executive of Microsoft in 2000 to focus on software development and on 16 June 2006, he announced that he would move to a part-time role with Microsoft in 2008 to focus on his philanthropic work.
F. In 1973, Gates enrolled at Harvard University, where he met future business partner Steve Ballmer. Their first venture was to develop a version of the Basic programming language for
the Altair 8800, one of the first micro-
computers.
