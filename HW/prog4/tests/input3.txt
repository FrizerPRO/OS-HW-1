Short for Asynchronous Transfer Mode, a network technology is based on transferring data in cells or packets of a fixed size. The cell used with ATM is relatively small compared to units used with older technologies. The small, con- stant cell size allows ATM equipment to transmit video, audio, and computer data over the same network, and assure that no single type of data hogs the line. Some people think that ATM holds the answer to the Internet bandwidth prob- lem, but others are skeptical. ATM creates a fixed channel, or route, between two points whenever data
transfer begins. This differs from TCP/IP, in which mes- sages are divided into packets and each packet can take a dif- ferent route from source to destination. This difference makes it easier to track and bill data usage across an ATM network, but it makes it less adaptable to sudden surges in network traffic.
